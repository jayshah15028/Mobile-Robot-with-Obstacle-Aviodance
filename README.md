# Mobile-Robot-with-Obstacle-Aviodance

The IR sensors mounted at the front, left and right can be seen. The Arduino is placed on top plate and the motor shield with L293D DC motor driver is mounted on Arduino. The IMU is mounted on the rear side of the robot. The control architecture can be seen in Figure 5. The main loop in the Arduino contains of forward motion commands to the DC motors driving the wheels. An interrupt function is built which is triggered by the FALLING edge of the pin to which the front IR sensor is connected. Inside this interrupt function, the IR sensors on the left and the right are read and depending upon those readings, a decision is made to turn left or right for the vehicle and yaw value is read from the IMU sensor and a desired yaw value is set on the PID controller which then gives the control signal to the motors to drive the wheels such that a pure rotation of 900 about the center of the robot is obtained.
